I got a good blank packman map and am now trying to replace all '&' with 'space'. Over half way
through but I still am going to need to set over 82,000 variables. I am hoping to be able to 
set all of them with the "for" command. I need to figure out a way to put ANCII characters into
cmd without getting strange outputs. 
(Now realizing much later I could have done find and replace -_-)

Finally finished removing all '&'! I learned that I made a mistake while replacing all '&' and
now need to decide how many characters long and wide I want the character to be.

It has been way to long. I decided that I will make the character 27 characters wide and 12
characters tall.

Learned about chcp 65001! ASCII characters finally work! Next up, fixing up the board (again).

I finally added buttons! I messed arround with the code for the colors of the buttons and I got
Some unexpected results. Also worked on the intro animation.

I have an idea that hopefully will allow me to make the board all variables. Learned about a
problem with ascii characters in cmd and am hoping to find a way around it (forgot to log this)

Learned that there is a limit to tokens in a for loop. Found a way around it that hopefully
will solve all of my problems. Also fixed the board up. The board is now all variables! The
variables take up a little over 1MB. Next step, create a rendering process.

I am very hesitant to get started on the next step. I have to make new code in order to 
prevent the variable process from slowing down the entire program. Turns out that having over
82,000 variables creates a lot of stress.
