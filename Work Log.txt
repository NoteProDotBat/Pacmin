I got a good blank packman map and am now trying to replace all '&' with 'space'. Over half way
through but I still am going to need to set over 82,000 variables. I am hoping to be able to 
set all of them with the "for" command. I need to figure out a way to put ANCII characters into
cmd without getting strange outputs. 
(Now realizing much later I could have done find and replace -_-)

Finally finished removing all '&'! I learned that I made a mistake while replacing all '&' and
now need to decide how many characters long and wide I want the character to be.

It has been way to long. I decided that I will make the character 27 characters wide and 12
characters tall.

Learned about chcp 65001! ASCII characters finally work! Next up, fixing up the board (again).

I finally added buttons! I messed arround with the code for the colors of the buttons and I got
Some unexpected results. Also worked on the intro animation.

I have an idea that hopefully will allow me to make the board all variables. Learned about a
problem with ascii characters in cmd and am hoping to find a way around it (forgot to log this)

Learned that there is a limit to tokens in a for loop. Found a way around it that hopefully
will solve all of my problems. Also fixed the board up. The board is now all variables! The
variables take up a little over 1MB. Next step, create a rendering process.

I am very hesitant to get started on the next step. I have to make new code in order to 
prevent the variable process from slowing down the entire program. Turns out that having over
82,000 variables creates a lot of stress.

I decided to make the view 91x32. Still working on the rendering process. I am thining that I
would rather have code that works and then work on improving efficiency later after I know how
I did it.

DATE 8/9/2022
I have created step 1 of the rendering process by creating a way for my program to search for
variables that it needs. Next step, allign the variables to their correct possitions.

Sorry for taking so long to update! Very buisy. Got render process to work. I think you are
able to see the entire board. (If you want to wait hours).
